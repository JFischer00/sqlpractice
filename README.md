# SQL Practice Queries
This is a collection of SQL queries I completed from the book [SQL Practice Problems](https://sqlpracticeproblems.com) by Sylvia Moestl Vasilik. The problems are grouped by skill level and range from simple select statements to complex queries involving joins, CTEs, temp tables, and window functions.
